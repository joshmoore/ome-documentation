The Data Manager

The OMERO.insight default view is made up of three sections: the Inspector Panel, the Working Area Panel and the Metadata Browser Panel.

The Inspector Panel

Navigating and Managing the Hierarchies
The standardised  view of the image data is in the Project, Dataset, Image hierarchy. Expanding the navigation tree allows you to see this structure.

The Inspector Panel - Screens   


Support for High Content Screening Formats - OMERO supports the reading of several High Content Screening formats which are displayed in a Screen - Plate - Well hierarchy. If you are interested in this type of data, please ask for more information. 


The Inspector Panel - Tags   



A tag can belong to a parent object called a tag set. For example a typical arrangement can be:

The Inspector Panel - Search  


This panel allows you to search on the images within the OMERO system. The search field allows you to search on the range of
contexts of Name, Comments, URL, Description, Tags, and Attachments. The results of the search are presented in the working area panel. 
The search field also supports multiple and single character wild card searching.
