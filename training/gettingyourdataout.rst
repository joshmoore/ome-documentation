Getting Your Data Out of OMERO 


Overview

   This page describes how to export, save, and publish any image files that you have stored in OMERO. 

[NOTE - YOU TEND TO ALTERNATE SOME SUB-HEADINGS WITH CAPITALS FOR ALL FIRST LETTERS AND OTHERS ALL LOWER CASE. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THIS CONSISTENT.]

Export to OME-TIFF
 
The OMERO.insight client has the option to export your full image stack and associated metadata in OME-TIFF file format. This is available for all images on the OMERO server. In the metadata panel on the right hand side, click on the export icon. This will open the Export dialogue box where you should specify the filename and location you wish to save the image to.

Export a Report
By selecting a dataset, it is possible to generate a report about this dataset. [**SCOTT, THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ENOUGH DETAIL OF HOW TO SELECT A DATASET OR HOW TO EXPORT THE REPORT. IS THERE A HISTORICAL REASON WHY THIS ICON IS ON THE MIDDLE PANEL, WHEN ALL OF THE TAGS ARE ON THE RIGHT HAND PANEL? ALSO THIS MAKES ME AGAIN THINK THAT THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A REFERENCE FIGURE WITH ALL ICONS LABELLED**] This exports an excel spreadsheet containing both a summary of all the Tags associated with the images in this dataset and thumbnails of all images.

Export Thumbnails

(I would like to check/discuss this option - OK)


Save the Image Rendering Settings

In the image viewer there is an icon which allows you to save the rendering to disk as an image file. Images can be saved for the Image, Split and Projection view modes. [I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IT IS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH, AND I AM NOT SURE THAT IT IS A LOGICAL PLACE FOR THIS TO BE INCLUDED. PERHAPS ALL THE RENDERING DETAILS SHOULD BE IN THE SECTION ON VIEWING YOUR DATA? OR MAYBE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND I'M NOT GETTING IT]

Publishing Options
In the metadata browser panel found on the right hand side, locate the  icon [ARE YOU INTENTIONALLY LEAVING A SPACE AS YOU INTEND TO ADD A PICTURE OF THE ICON BEFORE THE WORD ICON?]. Clicking on this icon will reveal a drop-down menu of publishing tools as shown below.

Make Movie - Select this to create a movie from your multi-dimensional image data. You can specify the ranges of Z and T frames to use. You can choose whether to display a scale bar and/or any labels.

Split View Figure - Choose one or more images to be arranged in a split-channel view figure with one image per row. When making the figure, for each image you can select which channels should be shown individually and which are included in the merged panel for that row.

[BE CAREFUL OF INTERCHANGEABLY USING FIGURE & IMAGE - I'VE ALSO ADDED PANEL HERE TO TRY AND HELP - IT CAN EASILY BECOME VERY CONFUSING]

ROI Split Figure - If a rectangle ROI has been defined for an image (or images), then you can create a figure that displays the ROI as a larger panel to the right of the main image, zoomed by a chosen factor. The zoomed ROI can be split into selected channels, as for the split-view figure. Images can be labeled with their name, the name of their dataset(s) or associated tags.

Thumbnail Figure - This creates a figure of thumbnails, either using the currently selected images or all of the images in a dataset. The date range of the images is displayed on the figure, and it is also possible to choose a list of tags to sort the images by.

Movie Figure? [I THINK YOU HAVE TO COVER ALL OPTIONS THAT APPEAR IN INSIGHT AS WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED]
